The tricky collection of Algorithmses of C++.

This is programs that, is not business but a one which I show as entertainment. In fact, I do not execute a them, but carry out codes to show on a PowerPoint. I make the tricky collection of Algorithmses of C++. 

The summary of a program 
Main Function:   It generates the Instances of each Algorithms, input into the Arguments of a Functions “executeAlgorithms", and perform “executeAlgorithms”.
Function "executeAlgorithms":   It performs each Algorithmses and output each Submission Time to a standard Console. 
Class "ParentOfAlgorithms":   It is a Superclass of each Algorithms. It offers features common to subclasses. 
Each Algorithm:   They are each Algorithms. They give featureses, such as a Definitions of an Algorithms, a Submit, and measurement of the time required. 

The following is the description described by the presentation Handouts.

C++, with the C language,  becomes a quite old category in a popular programming language currently. Although big differences among some are between other popular languages, and C/C++s, probably, the maximum thing is the poorness of language specification which develops a program safely. 
C++ born in 1983 continued evolution in Long history, and has gained some of modern featureses which present-day languages have. The language specification which can, on the other hand, describe a Code with dangerous C/C++ still remains. It has not been improved by this but I have dared to leave it.
because -- as the request which is not in other languages which C/C++ has -- besides safety, it is because priority may be given to a Velocity at the sacrifice of highly efficient - various functions -- pliability, ease of Maintenance, and intelligibility even if. 
Codes which I will show from now on are dangerous Algorithms it is better not to use if possible. However, rather than the usual Algorithms, some in it are high speeds and can be said to be being tips so to speak.
